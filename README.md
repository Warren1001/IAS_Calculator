### v1.1.2
- Allowed non-Paladins to select any melee weapon when using Zeal, since Zeal charges exist.

### v1.1.1
- Added the ability to select Werewolf and Werewolf skills to all player classes. This will be removed once the event is over.

### v1.1.0
- Added Burst of Speed for all classes (Hustle).
- Added Mark of the Bear for all character classes (Metamorphosis).

### v1.0.7
- Bug fix for skill IAS tables

### v1.0.6
- Fixed Strafe tables not displaying properly.

### v1.0.5
- Fixed dual-wielded tables using WIAS, hopefully it all works now?
- Fixed being unable to unequip the second weapon when swapping from a skill that required two weapons to a skill that could use two weapons but wasn't required to.

### v1.0.4
- Fixed Assassin claw speeds showing tables for skills that wasn't possible.

### v1.0.2
- Fixed Paladin's basic attack for two handed weapons and two handed swords. The two handed sword animation has two different animation lengths, but I mistakenly had the two handed weapon animation with two different animation lengths.
- Updated the Assassin's basic attack with the claws change from the 2.5 PTR v1.

### v1.0.1
- Fixed multihitting skills last hit, breakpoints are correct now
- Fixed "is one handed" checkbox appearing for Whirlwind when it doesn't change the breakpoints at all
- Fixed the one-off Whirlwind bugs (might have fixed it in the last update, don't remember)

- There's still one minor bug when using WIAS inputs when you are 1 WIAS away from the breakpoint, the table won't update and still shows 2 IAS. Otherwise, the two-handed sequence skills are difficult to show contextual numbers for, so certain configurations may appear weird but are actually correct. I'm still thinking on the best way to present the information in a less confusing way.
- I plan to work on the Assassin claws attack speed "fixes" from the 2.5 PTR next.

### v1.0.0
- Restructured a lot of the code.
- Redesigned how the UI functions, inputs work top down. Examples:
  - Setting skill to Double Swing for Barbarian will only let you choose one-handable weapons.
  - Choosing Werebear on any non-Druid class only allows Standard and Kick skills.
- Whirlwind is fully updated.
- Updated info messages again.
- Added favicon :) (little icon in the tab)

### v0.17.0
- Updated Whirlwind for Barbarian single-handed after D2R 2.4.3, a bug fix or two.

### v0.16.0
- Fixed NaN for unarmed Mercenaries.
- Tested Kick (KK) animations (Barrels, etc), they should all be correct given the information available.
- Added Dodge animation breakpoints, 'Dodge' is the same as Avoid and Evade. Dodge is only impacted by SIAS, so Fanaticism is the only way to speed it up, and Holy Freeze, Chilled, and Slows Target is the only way to slow it down.
- Added Slows Target modifier for PvP. Maximum is 50%.
- Added Chilled modifier (cold damage (chill length)/freeze length (chill length)/Freezes Target (chill length) without CBF), always -50 SIAS.
- Fixed a bug where Holy Freeze wasn't being affected by its maximum slow value (maximum slow is -50 against players).
- Modified some infos.

### v0.15.0
- Literally everything should be correct for 2.4, with the exception of off-hand Normal Attack for Characters (untested).
- All wereform animations should be correct in all cases.
- All dual wielding skills should be correct.
- All breakpoints where EIAS would be <0 should be correct.
- All sequence skills (Frenzy, Double Swing, Dragon Claw, Fists of Fire, A5 Merc Normal Attack, etc) should be correct.
- Impale should be correct.
- Strafe bug was fixed in D2R/2.4, 2 frame attack is actually reachable.
- Whirlwind is correct. Whirlwind does hit on the 4th and 8th frame, the hit-check bug works differently than people think it does.

### v0.14.5
- Fixed bug with dual wielding Act 5 Mercenary.
- Updated some infos.

### v0.14.4
- Fixed EIAS iteration in some instances to show accurate breakpoints possibilities.

### v0.14.3
- Changed link data separator so it won't break in Twitch Chat.

### v0.14.2
- Fixed Werewolf and Werebear skills being reversed

### v0.14.1
- Updated some info messages

### v0.14.0
- Updated a lot of the code behind the scenes.
- Fixed a lot of small issues that had creeped into the calculator with 2.4.
- Fury was updated with fair test results in the previous calc update.
